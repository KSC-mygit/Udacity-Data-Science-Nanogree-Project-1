# Udactiy Data Scientist Nanodegree - Project 1

This project is completed as part of the curriculum for the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program. In this project I will answer three questions using data on a population of mutual funds in the United States.

## Libraries used
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Sklearn

## Files Used
I used the `MutualFunds.csv` which can be downloaded from Kaggle at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/mutual-funds-and-etfs?select=MutualFunds.csv
Special thanks to Stefao Leone for making this dataset available on Kaggle. The original data was scrapped from Yahoo Finance (https://finance.yahoo.com/). 

I downloaded the data source from Kaggle that had been last updated on December 12, 2021. A copy of this file is included with this project. The file was too large to be uploaded on GitHub without being compressed hence the file is provided in zipped format. Please unzip the file first before running the code.

Please note that downloading the data directly from Kaggle using the link provided above may generate a more recent version of the dataset which may not be fully consistent with the results obtained at the time of this project. To ensure consistency with the results in this analysis please use the accompanying copy of the `MutualFunds.csv` file.
